### Testing

This project is fully tested. We have an [automatic pipeline](https://github.com/josepostiga/larabeat/actions) and an [automatic code quality analysis](https://coveralls.io/github/josepostiga/larabeat) tool set up to continuously test and assert the quality of all code published in this repository, but you can execute the test suite yourself by running the following command:

``` bash
vendor/bin/phpunit

**We aim to keep the master branch always deployable.** Exceptions may happen, but they should be extremely rare.
